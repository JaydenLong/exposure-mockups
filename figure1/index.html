		<p> Figure 1 displays the steady state and time constant curves for the fast sodium current (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?I_{Na}" title="I_{Na}" align="middle"/>). 
		The equation for this component is as follows: </p>
		<p>                                                                             <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?I_{Na}&space;=&space;G_{Na}m^{3}hj\left&space;(&space;V&space;-&space;E_{Na}&space;\right&space;)" title="I_{Na} = G_{Na}m^{3}hj\left ( V - E_{Na} \right )" align="middle"/>      (1)</p>
		<p>The formulation of this component originates from Hodgkin and Huxley (1952). This paper introduced the generic equation for ionic currents which was formulated from experimental results. These experiments were performed on the squid giant axon at varying temperatures. The fast sodium current used in this model was further improved by Beeler & Reuter (1977) in which they introduced the three gates formulation that is used. </p>
		<p>The steady state activation and inactivation curves produced by this model were fitted to data obtained by Nagatomo et al. (1998). These experiments were performed on human HEK-293 cells at 23 &degC and 33 &degC. Data from these experiments was extrapolated to 37 &degC and is represented by the points on the figures below. </p>
